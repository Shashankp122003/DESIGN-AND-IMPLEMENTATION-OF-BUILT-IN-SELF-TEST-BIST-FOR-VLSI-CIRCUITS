# DESIGN-AND-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-BUILT-IN-SELF-TEST-BIST-FOR-VLSI-CIRCUITS
BIST verifies all or a portion of the internal functionality of the IC. It is becoming an integral part of many time critical circuits recently. In this experiential learning assignment, a complete BIST design was implemented for full adder which included Output Response Analyzer (ORA) , Test Pattern Generator.
